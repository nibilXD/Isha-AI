## Advanced Usage (Async + Multiple Endpoints)

```python
import asyncio
from isha import Client, IshaError

async def main():
    client = Client(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

        tasks = [
            client.data.get("events"),
            client.data.get("messages"),
            client.data.get("notifications")
        ]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

        for name, result in zip(["Events", "Messages", "Notifications"], results):
            print(f"\n{name}: {len(result)} items")
            for item in result[:3]:  # show first 3
                print(" -", item)

    except IshaError as e:
